The question tells you that the L allele, which is for fuzzy leaves, is dominant over the l allele, which is for smooth leaves. Fuzzy leaves is the dominant allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the dominant version of the leaf texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy leaves must have the genotype LL or Ll. There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below. Smooth leaves is the recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the recessive version of the leaf texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with smooth leaves must have the genotype ll. There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below."

        "gold_label_rationale": "Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a dwarf body or a normal-sized body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body. A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb. There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait.

In 1963, control over the western half was transferred to Indonesia, which had just gained independence from the Netherlands.

        "gold_label_rationale": "Solution: On the graph, the year is shown on the x-axis. The volume of fresh water withdrawn in a year is shown by the height of each bar. To determine which statement is supported by the data, evaluate how the volume of fresh water withdrawn changed over time. The volume of fresh water withdrawn per year increased steadily until 1980. From 1950 to 1980, each bar is taller than the one before it. This means that the volume of fresh water withdrawn per year increased steadily until 1980. So, this statement is supported by the data. The volume of fresh water withdrawn per year increased every five years between 1950 and 2005. From 1950 to 1980, each bar is taller than the one before it. But after 1980, the bars do not continue to get taller. This means that the volume withdrawn did not always increase between 1950 and 2005. So, this statement is not supported by the data."
