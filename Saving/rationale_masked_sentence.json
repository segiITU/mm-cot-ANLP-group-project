    "20788": "Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait.. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.. Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait.. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene.. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.. There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn.. These boxes are highlighted below.. Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait.. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene..
