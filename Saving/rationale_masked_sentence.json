    "21021": "Solution: Look at the picture of the musk ox. The musk ox has skin with thick fur on top and a thick layer of fat underneath it. Its skin is adapted for survival in cold places. The musk ox uses its fur and fat to keep warm in cold weather. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The snowy owl has a thick coat of feathers covering its skin. Its skin is adapted for survival in cold places. The Amazon milk frog has thin, moist skin",

    "21040": "Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter. Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter",
    "21049": "Solution: Look at the table and images. Sasha wants broccoli. Franco wants tomatoes. They can trade tomatoes for broccoli to both get what they want",
    "21061": "Solution: To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other. The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract",
    "21080": "Solution: The city is San Antonio, Texas. New Orleans, Atlanta, and Washington, D.C",
    "21082": "Solution: A sea otter is an animal. It eats animals that live in the ocean. Sea otters have very thick fur. Their fur keeps them warm in cold water. A marsh marigold is a plant. It can grow yellow flowers",

    "21100": "Solution: An egg white is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own",
    "21103": "Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B",
    "21114": "Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the mushroom. The only arrow pointing from the grizzly bear leads to the earthworm. No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the grizzly bear to the mushroom. The only arrow pointing from the parasitic jaeger leads to the earthworm. No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms",
    "21168": "Solution: Look at the picture of the flat-tail horned lizard. The flat-tail horned lizard has sand-colored scales covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert. The word camouflage means to blend in. Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation. The Namaqua chameleon has sand-colored scales covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in a sandy desert. The strawberry poison frog has brightly colored skin",
